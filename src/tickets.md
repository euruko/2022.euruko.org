### Scholarship/diversity tickets

There are both virtual and in-person tickets available for members of historically marginalised or under-represented communities. Please note in-person tickets **do not** include travel or accomodation and our budget only allows us to give away a limited number of in-person tickets.

### Tickets for non-profits

If you run a non-profit that promotes tech skills or careers among historically marginalised or under-represented communities you can apply for tickets to give away to your attendees or members as you see fit. The exact number and type of tickets are decided on a case-by-case basis.

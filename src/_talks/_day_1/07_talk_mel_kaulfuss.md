summary: Discover how to approach CI/CD with an SRE mindset. Learn what SLOs, SLIs & error budgets are, and how to define them for your own build & deploy processes. Rebuild trust with your system’s stakeholders, and reclaim control over slow & unreliable build and deploy processes.

Continuous Integration and Deployment is the automation of building and testing code, CI/CD allows teams to ship code easily and frequently, with a high level of trust that end users won’t be impacted by bugs. What happens when painfully slow and unreliable CI/CD systems hinder our ability to deliver?

Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) guide their efforts with a set of agreed service level objectives (SLOs) and service level indicators (SLIs). A set of parameters that define what a system's users should reasonably expect, and measure their performance.
Join Buildkite’s Mel Kaulfuss to discover how to approach CI/CD with an SRE’s mindset. Learn what SLOs and SLIs are, and how to define them for your own build and deploy processes in order to create a shared understanding between a system’s stakeholders (most commonly its maintainers and users).

You’ll learn:

- What SLOs and SLIs are
- How to define SLOs and SLIs for your build, testing and deployment processes
- How to use them to effectively drive continuous improvement
- How to approach your CI/CD architecture just as you would your production systems:
  - Availability & Uptime on self managed cloud hosted servers
  - Performance & Speed with job parallelisation and autoscaling clusters
  - Abstraction & Extensibility by managing infrastructure as code
  - Observability & Insights via access to useful data, real time monitors and metrics

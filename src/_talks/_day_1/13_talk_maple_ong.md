Did you know Ruby optimizes your code before executing it? If so, ever wonder how that works? The Ruby VM performs various optimizations on bytecode before executing them, one of them called peephole optimizations.

Peephole optimizations come in various forms that are simple yet extremely impactful in making bytecode more elegant, concise, and performant! Let’s learn about how some peephole optimizations work and how these small changes impact the execution of Ruby’s bytecode.

This is a broad talk which reviews all of the things which enable Ruby developers to work in a fun, enjoyable programming language which is secure, allows for easy package management, and has a supportive community. Specifically we will be tracking money spent and code shipped. This will cover a lot of ground quickly and broadly, with lots of humor, so it will be both compelling and informative for the viewer.

- Ruby, the language - who wrote it originally and who writes it now? What do they work on? Who is paid and who is a volunteer? How are decisions made (what is the governance model)?
- Rails and other frameworks - who wrote it originally and who writes it now? What do they work on? Who is paid and who is a volunteer? How are decisions made (what is the governance model)?
- Package management and Bundler - how does package management work (simplified)? How do bugs get filed and who fixes them? Who is paid and who is a volunteer?
- Gems and libraries - who writes them? How do they become popular? What happens to libraries where package maintainers who lose interest or burn out? What can we do about this?
- Community events - what are the big ones? The small ones? What are the regional Ruby organizations? Who supports and organizes these events? Which are IRL and which are online?
- Who are the largest companies who depend on Ruby or Rails? How much do they support the infrastructure?
- New Ruby developers - who is teaching Ruby and/or Rails at bootcamps? At colleges? Who is teaching themselves and what languages do they come from? What languages do people leave Ruby for, if at all?

# What is Euruko?

Euruko is a Ruby conference organised annually, each year in a different European city chosen by the participants. In 2021 it was organised online, and in 2022 we’re organising a hybrid conference in Helsinki, Finland on the 13th and 14th of October. The venue we’ve selected is [Paasitorni](https://www.paasitorni.fi/en/about-us/history/), right in the heart of Helsinki.

# Keep Euruko affordable

Sponsoring Euruko gets you the opportunity to reach an international group of talented and passionate developers. Euruko is the biggest Ruby conference in Europe and one of the biggest in the world.

There’s a long tradition to keep Euruko tickets as affordable as possible to offer everyone the opportunity to attend and sponsors are an essential part of this.

The Euruko CFP for in-person talks will open in good time before the event itself. We previously announced a date of August 1st but are currently re-evaluating that based on feedback that we received. We will also hold back a reserve of in-person tickets for CFP participants (though we cannot guarantee a reserved ticket for every submitter).

We're looking for a wide range of topics related to Ruby, coding, and everything related to that. We're aiming to have a balance of talks aimed at diverse levels of expertise.

All talks and speakers must adhere to the conference [code of conduct](/code). Submissions are evaluated anonymously in the first phase (in other words we don't don't see the speaker details) by a small team of volunteers. Talks with the highest ratings move onto a second round of evaluation where the programme committee evaluates them for programme fit, content, relevant experience, etc. We aim to have a well balanced and diverse talk line-up.

Talks are expected to be 30 minutes long, not including a short Q&A section after the talk. The questions in the Q&A section are screened and moderated. If your talk is selected, you should be prepared to travel to Helsinki in October to give the talk in-person.

Talks will be livestreamed, recorded, and published.

## Speaker Benefits

* Free entry to Euruko 2022 (or a full refund if you previously purchased a ticket)
* Reimbursement of travel expenses up to a limit (limit TBA)

**Note:** for sessions with more than one speaker, the travel expenses budget is split among all speakers.
